This is my first foray into blogging on my own platform that I manage myself! Here I'll explore interesting topics and tech.

## I'm still working on building this blog.

This site is created with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/). Posts and pages are generated from Markdown using a plugin called [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/), which is just one of many available in the feature-rich gatsby plugin ecosystem. I'm learning as I go, with every new feature I add.

I could have just set-up a WordPress site for ease but I wanted to explore new tech and break new shiny things â€” symptoms of [Shiny Object Syndrome](https://dev.to/cerchie/the-line-between-willingness-to-learn-and-shiny-object-syndrome-1457)

## I have a long journey ahead.

For now, there's no pagination, keyword search, tags, categories, SEO optimization, or even custom `<title>` tags. This site is a big work in progress and instead of waiting for a finished, perfect blog site (never going to happen), I'm just sending this out to the world and hoping for the best.

I believe in the kindness and generosity of the open-source community. [This codebase](https://github.com/neilitalia/gatsby-md-blog) is open for issues, pull requests, and constructive criticism.

## I'm proud of how far I've come.

Blogging has always been a goal for me. This site barely existed a few weeks ago, now I have something I fully developed, debugged, and designed myself. I tried to model the site design after my [main website](http://neilitalia.dev/).

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is an amazing tool that increased my productivity. I barely need to write my own CSS styles. All the custom styles I've written from my main website, I easily copy-pasted into this site.

I'm also pretty happy with how this subdomain (https://blog.neilitalia.dev/) is built with Gatsby/React, while my apex domain (https://blog.neilitalia.dev/) is built with Vue.js. I didn't have the knowledge on making something like this weeks ago. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) makes it so easy!

## But wait, how did I get here?

This site is borne from [VirtualCoffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/)'s monthly challenge for November 2021 where the awesome community [wrote 50k words together](https://virtualcoffee.io/monthlychallenges/nov-2021/)! I didn't contribute to this, unfortunately.

It's January ~~2021~~ 2022 as of writing and instead of giving up on my goal of starting a blog, I thought I'd pursue it despite the timing. Better late than never, right?

## Where do I go from here?

My ultimate goal is to keep this site alive and add more features as I see fit. I've been wanting to start a long-term pet project and a blog seems to be a great idea for it.

I would add a `Back to Top` button here if it existed, I guess I'll have to make one. I would also plug my social media links here. I really need to make a `<Footer/>` component.

For now, here's my [main site](http://neilitalia.dev/), [my GitHub](https://github.com/neilitalia), [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neilitalia/), and [my email!](mailto:hello@neilitalia.dev)

## Thanks for reading!
