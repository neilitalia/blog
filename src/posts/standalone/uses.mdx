If you haven't guessed yet, I'm a huge nerd. I have a lot of tech-related playthings. This is a list detailing a variety of tools and tech I use on an almost daily basis. This list is inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) created by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## Software

- **Windows 10** + **WSL2** - development supercharged by Ubuntu 18.04, because I will probably break whatever distro I'm running
- **Chrome** - my daily driver for web browsing, enhanced by uBlock and Tabliss
- **Firefox** - has an awesome console and HTTP testing interface
- **Spotify** - hyperpop beats for coding
- **Slack** - professional comms
- **Discord** - comms for friends

## Engineering

- **Visual Studio Code** - I basically live here
- **Windows Terminal** - running WSL2, enhanced by oh-my-zsh and powerlevel10k
- **CaskaydiaCove NF** - great font for programming, with support for powerline symbols

## Hardware

This is why I would prefer working from home, on my own machine.

- **AMD Ryzen 7 2700** - delicious 8-core 16-thread processing power
- **NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti** - has served me well for the past few years, waiting for current GPU prices to drop
- **HyperX Fury 16GB RGB RAM** - cool customizable rainbow lights
- **2x Sceptre C305B-200UN1** - 30-inch curved ultrawides with a 200Hz buttery smooth refresh rate
  - Left: Browsing, Devtools, API Testing
  - Right: VSCode
- **2x Dell P2213F** - flanking my ultrawide monitors in portrait mode, bought used for $30 each
  - Left: Spotify, Slack, and Discord
  - Right: Terminal
- **Lenovo Yoga 720 15"** - coding on the couch and casual laptop use

## Gadgets

I tried to downsize but all these things spark joy.

- **Google Nest Hub** - Hey Google, turn on all my lights
- **Sony WF-100-XM3** - the best noise-cancelling wireless earphones
- **Pimoroni Keybow 2040** - a circuitpython-powered macro pad that allows me to quickly:
  - Toggle my Zoom camera or microphone
  - Switch between windows and tabs
  - Adjust the volume on my PC and Google Nest Hub
  - Skip, pause, and rewind music
- **Keychron K2** - bluetooth, RGB, clicky switches, with Razer Phantom Keycaps

## Coffee

I used to think of coffee as just another energy drink. After espresso, I discovered how much personality and nuance it can have.

- **Breville Bambino** - great compact espresso machine
- **OXO Conical Burr Coffee Grinder** - provides me freshly ground beans
